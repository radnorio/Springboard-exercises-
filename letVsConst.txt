const PI = 3.14 will cause an error when changing the value of PI;

1.) Var values can be redeclared multiple times while let only allows you to declare the value once.

2.) var allows you to reasign and redeclare a value multiple times, but const will only let you declare
one time, and you will not be able to reasign the value either.

3.) let will allow you to reasign a value to an object while const will not

4.) hoisting allows you to declare functions and variables before using them. When you call these functions in your code,
you are hoisting their declarations to the top of the scope they are declared in.
